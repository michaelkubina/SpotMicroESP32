# Assembly #
This document describes the assembly process for the SpotMicroESP32. There are some prerequisites to make, before you can begin with the assembly of your printed parts and before you can mount your parts into place. Make sure you have the necessary parts from the [3D-printed Partlist](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/parts/SpotMicroESP32_parts_v1_0_0/). You will need at least the screws and nuts from the [Bill of Materials](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32#bill-of-material).

**Important! Read the assembly guide at least once, so you are familiar with when to use mirrored parts or which servo should be mounted with which actual gear-position.**

## Prerequisites ##
The single most important thing is to test and to calibrate your servos. By calibration i mean to determin the minimum and maximum positions, and what dutycicle results in what actual angle. Don't use any servos, that behave weird in any way, such as: stuttering, grinding noises, clicking noises or which wont turn at least full 180° - you would regret it afterwards and will have to do a lot of disassembling stuff to get it straight. At last it is important, that you position each servo into a specific position, which will be named in the parts-list in each major step. Depending on where it should be mounted, it results in 2x 0° 2x 60°, 2x 120°, 2x 180° and 4x 90°. Make sure you **add all the rubber dampeners** to your servos, so you could fit the M3 through the mounting holes.
If you wish to use fabric hoses, make sure you use the smallest and thinest possible. There is just not enough space in these parts to use thick ones. Or simply go with the standard servocable, which could look pretty nice, depending on your color theme.

### Servo Calibration ###

This section gives a brief explenation, of what is meant with servo calibration. You can use the values determined by this right away with [Maarten Weyns firmware](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/tree/master/code#firmware-and-app-by-maarten-weyn).

The servos you buy have most likely a larger overall movement range than the stated 180° or 270°. When doing the calibration steps, we are interested in several things:

- what is the minimum pwm signal, at which the servo starts actually moving?
- what is the maximum pwm singal, at which the servos actually stops its movement?
- what is the overall angle the servohorn did rotate between the minimum and maximum pwm singals? (**overall** movement range)
- what range in the overall movement range should represent our wanted 180° movement range with its corresponding PWM-values? (movement range)
- what ratio is there between the pwm-range and the movement angle? (conversion factor)

#### Example ####

Lets say you have a servo and feed it manually PWM-values, that you can easily increasy by 5, 10, 50, 100 or so. Also you have added a servohorn that allows you to see how far it did rotate in degree. This allows for gathering all informations needed for this calibration:

At a hypothetical PWM-value at 12 Bit resolution at a PWM-frequency of *50Hz(!)*:
- at 0 to 74 nothing happens and the servohorn does not want to move at all
- at 75 your servohorn actually moves...and stops at a certain position -> this is the minimum position of its **overall** movement range
- at 275 your servohorn did move forward exactly a quarter rotation -> so seen from the minimum of the **overall** movement range we have now progressed 90° further
- at 475 your servorhorn did an additional quarter rotation -> so we have now progressed even 180°
- now you increase the PWM-value even more and you see, that up to 510 your servohorn still rotates...and it stops at around 195°
- 511 to 4095 nothing happens anymore

What is happening here?

You have determined, that the minimum PWM-value that does anything is at 75, the maximum PWM-value that does anything is at 510. This results in an **overall** movement range of 195°, which is (in this example) 15° more than the 180° from the datasheet. Within this **overall** range we can now pick a movement range of 180°. Conveniently we would give ourselves a buffer before and after it (because the **overall** movement range allows for it), thus making the golden middle our 90° mark (= 97,5° from the **overall** movement range) and calculating or (even better) testing for the 0°/180° marks seen from there - this could be something like a PWM-Value of 92 (=7,5° of the **overall** movement range) and 492 (=187.5° of the **overall** movement range). This buffer allows for accounting for wear-off of the servos by software, instead of disassembling the robot to get the servos straight again.

So this has already answered the first four questions, about the PWM-Values and the angles those set the servo to. The last quesion about the conversion factor is just some simple maths and gives the idea of how much PWM-value increase is needed to rotate the servohorn by 1°. Like this:

- (510-75)/195° = 2.23 (conversion factor)
- (2.23 x 7,5°) + 75 ~= 92 (0° mark with a buffer of 7,5° before)
- (2.23 x 7,5°) + 475 ~= 492 (180° mark with a buffer of 7,5° after)

## Wrist ##
You need to make two identical wrists each for both sides - this means, that you need two mirrored pieces for the wrist and wrist counterpiece. Its important that you extend the servo cable and if you use fabric hoses, to guide it through.

### Wrist counterpiece and ball bearing pin ###

Insert 4x M3 nuts into the small spaces in the wrist counterpiece. Insert now from above the servo into its pocket in the wrist counterpiece. Now push both the wrist counterpiece with the servo and the wrist with the foot tip together, closing all gaps. Be careful not to loose any M3 nuts and screw both parts together with 4x M3x20 screws.

### Wrist completed ###

Your assembled wrist should look like this one. Repeat it once again for the second left wrist and assemble the two mirrored (right-handed) right wrists.

![004 - Wrist Complete](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/004_lower_leg_complete.png)

## Upper Leg ##
You need to make two identical upper legs each for both sides - this means, that you need two mirrored pieces for the upper leg bottom shell, upper leg top shell, servohorn mount and ball bearing mount.

### Parts ###

**you might use only two M2x8 on each leg to screw the servohorn into place and thus reducing the amount of M2x8 screws and M2 nuts by 2/3**

**if you have M2x6 then use these instead of the M2x8 which are only in use, because it was easier to buy the screws and nuts in bulk**

**use the long version of the servohorn & ballbearing mount for improved resting position of the legs or stick to the normal version true to KDY-0523's design for the legs being at an angle when resting**

| 32x | M3x20 |
|  4x | M3x8 |
| 24x | M2 nuts |
| 24x | M2x8 |

### Servohorn mount ###

You need to screw the M2 nuts on the M2x8 first, otherwise it would hinder the mounting of the servohorn. You can't use the bare M2x8 screws without the nuts in this step, because they would stick out from the other side and touch the servo unavoidably, which would result in blocking the servo movement or other damage. **You might consider using M2x6 instead and ditch the need for M2 nuts here completly.** Screw the servohorn into place, using the middle hole on each little arm. Make sure that the two arms of the servohorn are perfectly perpendicular to the wrist, when mounted to the servogear at 0° resp 180° (depending which leg) and which arm was on top then. This is because the teeth are not an even number and by this not symmetrical which would either result in a gap between the lower and upper leg when resting or in the worst case, the servo could not rest in 0° or 180° position and always stutter thus pulling more current.

![005 - Servohorn & Servohornmount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/005_servohornmount_post.png)

### Attach Servohorn mount ###

Position the assembled servohorn mount to the wrist and make sure that the right arm ist on top. Otherwise remove the servohorn and turn it around as long as it sits perfectly perpendicular and attach it again. Screw the whole servohornmount with a M3x8 to the servo gear.

![006 - Servohornmount & Servo Gear](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/006_servohornmount_pre.png)

![006 - Servohornmount & Servo Gear](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/006_servohornmount_post_sideview.png)

### Attach Ballbearing mount ###

Push your 625ZZ Ball Bearing into the Ballbearing Mount (it should be are really tight fit). Afterwards push the ballbearing mount on the ballbearing pin of the wrist.

![007 - Ballbearing mount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/007_ballbearingmount_pre.png)

![007 - Ballbearing mount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/007_ballbearingmount_post_sideview.png)

### Upper Leg Bottom Shell preparation ###

Put four M3 nuts in the holes by the servo-pocket and push the servo into place. The two inner nuts are secured by the servo, the two out nuts might fall out so be careful not to lose them.

![008 - Bottom Shell & Servo](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/008_bottomshell_pre.png)

![008 - Bottom Shell & Servo](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/008_bottomshell_post.png)

### Route Cables through Upper Leg Top Shell ###

This part is a bit tricky, especialy when using fabric hoses for the servocables, since the space between the shells is very limited. Route your extended servocable from the wrist through the front hole of the top shell. Pull after that the servocable of the bottom shell servo through the hole as well. 

![009 - Top Shell & Bottom Shell](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/009_topshell_pre.png)

Then push both shells toghether and at the same time pull the cables carfully further through the hole. Make sure the servocable from the wrist goes into both shells through the gap between both shells and is further guided underneath the top shell in the groove specially made for it (marked green). You have also to watch out not to lose the two M3 nuts next to the servo.

![009 - Top Shell & Bottom Shell](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/009_topshell_mid_frontview.png)

![009 - Top Shell & Bottom Shell](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/009_topshell_mid_backview.png)

### Screw both shells together ###

When both shells are closed you might either move your cables freely back and forth through the hole, in the case you do not use fabric hoses. When using fabric hoses it might be to tight, so you must open the shells slightly, when you want to pull the cables further through.

![010 - Both Shells](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/010_bothshells_pre.png)

Use now four M3x20 to screw the servo into place and with it both the top and bottom shell, so they cant come apart without unscrewing them.

![010 - Both Shells](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/010_bothshells_mid.png)

![010 - Both Shells](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/010_bothshells_post.png)

### Complete Upper Leg ###

Now with both shell attached to each other and the servocables of the lower and upper leg routet through, place four M3 nuts in the four rear-facing pockets.

![011 - Preparations before completion](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/011_prepare_completion_pre.png)

![011 - Preparations before completion](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/011_prepare_completion_post.png)

Place then both shells on the wrist so that the screwholes in the servohorn and ballbearing mounts align with those in the shells. Use four M3x20 screws, to screw everything together to complete the upper leg.

![012 - Completion of the Upper Leg](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/012_completion_pre.png)

![012 - Completion of the Upper Leg](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/012_completion_post_transparent.png)

This is also the robots legs resting position, which results in the legs laying flat.

![012 - Completion of the Upper Leg](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/012_completion_post_sideview.png)

For the robots normal standing position the wrists servo is at 90° while the upper legs servo is at 120° or 60°, depending which leg.

## Shoulder Joint ##

You need to make two identical Shoulder Joints for both sides - this means, that you need two mirrored pieces for the Shoulder Joint Servomount. This time instead of mounting both on the right or left, each the left and right side will have one of the mirrored pieces.

### Parts ###

**you might use only two M2x8 on each servohorn cap to screw the servohorn into place and thus reducing the amount of M2x8 screws and M2 nuts by 2/3**

**if you have M2x6 then use these instead of the M2x8 which are only in use, because it was easier to buy the screws and nuts in bulk**

| Total Amount | Part |
|--------------|------|
|  4x | MG996R at 90° |
| 16x | Servo rubber dampeners (should be shipped with your servo) |
|  4x | FSH6S Servohorn |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  4x | [Shoulder Joint Servomount](../parts/SpotMicroESP32_parts_v1_0_0/README.md#shoulder-joints) (2x right-handed, 2x left-handed) |
|  4x | [Shoulder Joint Servohorn Cap](../parts/SpotMicroESP32_parts_v1_0_0/README.md#shoulder-joints) |
|  4x | [Shoulder Joint Ball Bearing Pin](../parts/SpotMicroESP32_parts_v1_0_0/README.md#shoulder-joints) |
|  |  |
|  |  |
| 36x | M3 nuts |
| 16x | M3x20 |
| 20x | M3x8 |
| 24x | M2 nuts |
| 24x | M2x8 |

### Servohorn Cap Preparation ###

You need to screw the M2 nuts on the M2x8 first, otherwise it would hinder the mounting of the servohorn. You can't use the bare M2x8 screws without the nuts in this step, because they would stick out from the other side and touch the servo unavoidably, which would result in blocking the servo movement or other damage. **You might consider using M2x6 instead and ditch the need for M2 nuts here completly.** Screw the servohorn into place, using the middle hole on each little arm.

![013 - Servohorn Cap Preparation](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/013_servohorncap_post.png)

### Attach Ballbearing Pin to Servomount ###

Insert 1x M2 nut into the small space in the Shoulderjoint Servomount. Screw 1x M2x8 through the ball bearing pin and attach it to the Shoulderjoint Servomount.

![014 - Attach Ballbearing Pin to Servomount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/014_shoulderpin_pre.png)

![014 - Attach Ballbearing Pin to Servomount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/014_shoulderpin_post.png)

### Attach Servohorn Cap to Servomount ###

Now insert 4x M3 nuts into to pockets in the base of the Servomount and screw the Servohorn Cap with 4x M3x8 into place.

![015 - Attach Servohorn Cap to Servomount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/015_servocap_servomount_pre.png)

![015 - Attach Servohorn Cap to Servomount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/015_servocap_servomount_post_solid_back.png)

### Attach Shoulder Joint to upper Leg ###

For the robots normal standing position the wrists servo is at 90° while the upper legs servo is at 120° (left legs) or 60° (right legs), depending which leg. Make sure you have actually positioned your servos correctly before, **otherwise you should do the movement befor assembling further**. When mounting the Shoulder Joint you wont align it to the upper leg along the upper star, but along the first to the right (left legs) resp. first to the left (right legs). Since the servohorn has six arms, each arm means an increase of 60°. For the left legs use this picture as an orientation.

![016 - Attach Shoulder Joint to upper Leg](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/016_shoulder_joint_leg_angles.png)

The assembly is straight forward. Take an M3x8 screw and screw the assembled shoulder joint into place, as mentioned above. It is intentional, that the upper leg wont move between both horizontal endpoints, but instead could retract the leg further to the back than to the front.

![016 - Attach Shoulder Joint to upper Leg](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/016_shoulder_joint_leg_pre.png)

![016 - Attach Shoulder Joint to upper Leg](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/016_shoulder_joint_leg_post_sideview.png)

### Attach Servo to Shoulder Joint ###

Make sure the servos you want to place are at 90°. Place 4x M3 nuts into the pockets for mounting the servo. Place the servo now into its pocket and screw it into place with 4x M3x20.

![017 - Attach Servo to Shoulder Joint](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/017_shoulder_joint_servomount_servo_pre.png)

![017 - Attach Servo to Shoulder Joint](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/017_shoulder_joint_servomount_servo_post.png)

### Shoulder Joint Completed ###

You have now succesfully attached the Shoulder Joint to the upper leg. With this you have now completed the front left leg. Repeat the steps for the other 3 legs and make sure you use the mirrored parts when building the right legs and the left legs. **And keep in mind, that the shoulder joint uses the mirrored parts for the front or rear leg on both sides!**

![018 - Shoulder Joint Completed](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/018_shoulder_joint_complete.png)

![018 - Shoulder Joint Completed](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/018_shoulder_joint_complete_sideview.png)

### Overview of all of the four legs ###

With the front left (FL) leg finished, rebuild the rear left (RL) leg with the same steps. But this time use the mirrored shoulder joint piece instead. The picture below shows both legs, where the only difference is the direction the servo in the shoulder joint is facing. Both gears should face outwards towards the nose or back of the robot.

![019 - Overview of all of the four legs](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/019_left_legs.png)

The same applies to the front right (FR) and rear right (RR) leg, with both servo gears facing outwards. Use for the right sided legs also the mirrored copies of the lower and upper leg parts. Keep in mind, that you have set the right angles for your servos prior to assembly, with the servos in the shoulder joint being at 90°, the servos in the upper legs at 60° and the servos in the wrists at 0°.

![019 - Overview of all of the four legs](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/019_right_legs.png)

When all of your legs are assembled the should look like this, with the front legs shoulder servos gears facing to the front of the robot and the rear shoulder servos facing backwards.

### Inner Shoulders ###

Add into each the top and bottom shoulder block two M3 nuts. Make sure you have oriented the blocks the right way, so that the pockets for the nuts that will be used to hold the covers are facing into the body.

![021 - Inner Shoulders](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/021_inner_shoulders_pre.png)

Screw the inner shoulder with four M3x8 screws into place, so that the screwsheads will sink into their pockets.

### Chassis ###

Take the chassis side piece and place four M3 nuts into their pockets - the flat side should face outwards and the long cutout for the circuitry mountingplate should be at the bottom. **Chose the mountingplate corresponding to your bigger buck converter - the XL4016 or SZBK07** https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/tree/master/electronics

![021 - Chassis](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/021_chassis_sides.png)

Put your ***(pre-populated ???)*** circuitry mountingplate between both sides.

![021 - Chassis](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/021_chassis_sides_circuitboardmount_pre.png)

![021 - Chassis](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/021_chassis_sides_circuitboardmount_post.png)

Now attach both inner shoulders to it with each four M3x8 screws and the bigger blocks being at the top.

![021 - Chassis](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/021_chassis_all_pre.png)

The assembled chassis should look like this.

## Head with ESP32-CAM ##

| Total Amount | Part |
|--------------|------|
|  1x | ESP32-CAM with OV2640 (Version 2! with slightly longer cable) |
|  2x | HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  1x | [Front Cover Optimized](../parts/SpotMicroESP32_parts_v1_0_0/README.md#hull) |
|  1x | [Sensormount for the ESP32-CAM](../parts/SpotMicroESP32_parts_v1_0_0/README.md#hull) |
|  1x | [Cameramount for the ESP32-CAM](../parts/SpotMicroESP32_parts_v1_0_0/README.md#hull) |
|  1x | [Cameramount Counterpiece for the ESP32-CAM](../parts/SpotMicroESP32_parts_v1_0_0/README.md#hull) |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  4x | M3 nuts |
|  6x | M3x8 |

Place the ESP32-CAM into the designated place of the Cameramount. Screw the counterpiece with two M3x8 screws into place, with the small pads facing towards the ESP32-CAM thus preventing the PCB from lifting. Place now the two HC-SR04 into their spaces in the sensormount-piece, but dont push them all way down yet. Instead leave some half centimeter space.. Push now the Cameramount-piece on top of if, so that the wedges slide on top of the HC-SR04 PCBs, thus preventing them from slipping back out again. It might be necessare to hone down a small portion of the lower ends of the wedges.

Place now four M3 nuts into the spaces in the front cover, push the sensor- & cameramount into place and screw all of it with four M3x8 screws into place. The head is now assembled.

## Head with OV7670 (DEPRECATED) ##

| Total Amount | Part |
|--------------|------|
|  1x | OV7670 VGA Camera w/o FIFO |
|  2x | HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor |
|  6x | 5mm LED (White) |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  1x | Front Cover |
|  1x | Sensormount |
|  1x | Cameramount |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  8x | M3 nuts |
|  8x | M3x8 |

### Cameramount ###

Place four M3 nuts into the pockets below the tilted camera-base.

![023 - Cameramount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/023_cameramount_nuts_pre.png)

![023 - Cameramount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/023_cameramount_nuts_post.png)

Screw your OV7670 VGA Camera into place with four M3x8 screws.

![023 - Cameramount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/023_camera_mate_pre.png)

![023 - Cameramount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/023_camera_mate_post.png)

### Sensormount ###

**You will need to bend (or solder) the pins of the HC-SR04 in a fashian that they are parallell to the PCB and facing inwards. If the pins are perpendicular to the PCB you would not have enough space, to attach the head to the body. If being parallel and facing outwards, you would not be able to do the assembly at all. If you feel more comfortable with soldering the cables directly to the PCB, do this instead.**

Place your six 5mm LED (white) into the six small holes of the sensormount with their pins in the orientation as seen in the image. The two white LEDs in the middle row (highlighted in pink or green) need to be rotated by 90°, otherwise you would not be able to assemble proberly.

![023 - Sensormount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/023_leds_pre.png)

![023 - Sensormount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/023_leds_post.png)

Place now both HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors into the sensormount, but dont push them into their pockets completly yet - leave them about half a centimeter of space for now. Make sure you have oriented them the right way, so that the internal oscillator fits into the small pocket at the sides of the sensormount. Place the assembled cameramount on top of it and push both pieces together. Make sure you route the pins of the LEDs through their holes at the top and bottom row, and the pins in the middle row along the camera-base near the HC-SR04's.

![023 - Sensormount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/023_sensormount_camermount_mate_pre.png)

When your Cameramount slides over the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors (still sticking out ca. half a centimeter), push the cameramount and the sensors gently down. 

![023 - Sensormount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/023_sensormount_camermount_mate_mid.png)

The Cameramount has two small wegdes (highlighted green) on the sides of the camera-base, which prevent the HC-SR04 from sliding out of their pockets. When pushing both the sensormount and the cameramount together, those wedges should push both HC-SR04 down. 

![023 - Sensormount](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/023_sensormount_camermount_mate_post.png)

### Build Assembly into front Cover ###

Place four M3 nuts into the spaces in the front cover.

![023 - Build Assembly into front Cover](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/023_front_cover_nuts.png)

Place the whole assembly into the front cover and screw it with four M3x8 into place.

![023 - Build Assembly into front Cover](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/023_mate_all_pre.png)

Your finished head-unit should look like this.

## Assembly Finished! ##

Congratulations, you have now succesfully assembled your SpotMicroESP32.

![027 - Assembly Finished!](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/blob/master/assembly/images/027_spotmicroesp32_complete.png)

# what's left? #

**The mountingplate for the circuitry is still missing and is currently being designed!**
Once it's ready i will add the steps necessary as a separate sections in the chassis part.
The mountingplate suits specifically this build. You might use different hardware as i did, and as of this need modifications. Please use the updated Template, once its all finished.

Furthermore i want to adress some shortcomings in this guide. I want to replace all images, where the rubber dampeners are missing (mea culpa) and i want to make it more clear, which servo has to be at which angle for assembly. I realize, that the description are sometimes not very clear...i will need to think of a way to clarify this.
